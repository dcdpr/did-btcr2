# did:btcr2 DID Method Specification

**did:btcr2** is a censorship resistant DID Method using the Bitcoin blockchain
as a Verifiable Data Registry to announce changes to the DID document.
It improves on prior work by allowing: zero-cost off-chain DID creation;
aggregated updates for scalable on-chain update costs; long-term identifiers
that can support frequent updates; private communication of the DID document;
private DID resolution; and non-repudiation appropriate for serious contracts.
